### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Niza (Cloudy), a backend development enthusiast with 2 years of experience slinging code. </br>
I'm currently studying for my BSc in Computing at the University of Greenwich. 
I'll be graduating in 2025!</br> 

My bread and butter these days is using Rust, JavaScript, Python, and 
anything else I can get my hands on. 
I geek out over tech like Docker, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes too.

Sure, I can do some basic front-end dev with HTML, CSS and frameworks like Vue. But I really love getting into application logic, databases, and making things run on the server side. I'm all about that backend life.

Moving forward, I want to expand my skills more into specialities like machine learning, cybersecurity, </br>
DevOps, and even pick up languages like Java, Ruby and Elixir. I know I've got a lot more learning and growing ahead!

Aside from rad tech skills, I also care about being productive, communicating clearly and writing solid, well-documented code. Just taking things one commit at a time!
